# NPCAlignmentResponse
NLP Program incorporating multiple classifiers to do sentiment analysis on text input to give an NPC's response of agreement or diagreement based on the alignment of the NPC.
Primarily will be focusing on the standard roleplaying tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) alignment chart.
The project will exclude the neutrals since Good vs Evil or Lawful vs Chaotic is already subjective, to more easily avoid confusion based on context.
